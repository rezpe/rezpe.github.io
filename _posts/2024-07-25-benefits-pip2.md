Implementing Pipelines 2.0 comes with a set of advantages:

### Data and Visualization

The interoperability between tasks means that the data should be easily interchangeable between nodes. This opens up a data-centric view of the workings in the computer where the result of each node can be inspected and utilized. This enhances transparency, understanding, and user engagement. 

Also EVERYTHING in the workflow should be accessible -from files and activity logs to execution details— as data. This data could take any structure, but if we can transform it into a data table, it can then be queried and visualized. This paradigm shift enables users to manipulate, join, and analyze data in a flexible manner, tailoring the information flow and visualization to their specific needs and preferences.

Through those dynamic charts, graphs, and interactive interfaces, users can visualize complex datasets, uncovering patterns and anomalies that would be difficult to detect in raw numerical form. This not only aids in decision-making but also enhances the ability to communicate findings and strategies effectively.

Moreover, being data-driven facilitates a more agile and responsive workflow. Users can adjust their strategies based on real-time data, iterate on processes quickly, and make informed decisions promptly. The ability to query and manipulate data directly, coupled with powerful visualization tools, empowers users to explore and understand their workflows deeply.

Incorporating data-driven methodologies and visualization into workflows ensures that every step, from initial data collection to final analysis, is grounded in a solid foundation of evidence and insight. 

### Workflows are great to incorporate the latest innovations

In the last years, we have witnessed the introduction of new interaction modalities—such as touch, virtual reality (VR) interfaces and natural language processing. Those new modalities significantly elevate productivity and user engagement. Touch and VR interfaces, for instance, offer intuitive and immersive ways to navigate and manipulate digital environments, making complex tasks more accessible and engaging. 

On the other hand, natural language processing enables users to execute commands, query data, and interact with systems in their spoken or written language, streamlining operations that traditionally required manual input or navigation through complex menus. 

Finally, virtual reality and its associated technologies like Augmented reality, Spatial Computing, … offer an immersive experience the takes into account the full world we live in and our full bodies.

We could envision workflow that span across several modalities, meaning that some nodes would run on a certain modality and other nodes on others. For instance, that would mean that some of the nodes would have an interface in the mobile phone or tablet, others on the desktop and others on Virtual reality.

### Agents and Generative AI

The integration of Generative AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), into workflows represents a transformative leap in how tasks are conceived, executed, and optimized. Currently, the field of flow engineering is being created as a methodology to create workflows for agents. And actually we could envision that some of the nodes in the workflow are done by agents and others by human which would introduce a better collaboration between agents and users. The role of LLMs in workflows embodies the potential for a synergistic collaboration between humans and AI, where each complements the other's strengths. Humans provide context, creativity, and strategic oversight, while AI offers scalability, speed, and data-processing capabilities. This partnership paves the way for workflows that are not only more productive but also more innovative and responsive to changes. What this means is that certain steps within these workflows can be autonomously performed or assisted by AI agents powered by LLMs. These agents can handle a wide range of tasks, from drafting emails and generating reports to more complex data analysis and decision-making processes, all aligned with the workflow's objectives. By automating routine or complex tasks, LLMs free up human users to focus on more strategic, creative, or nuanced aspects of their work, thereby enhancing productivity and job satisfaction.

Also these AI-driven systems can significantly enhance workflows by offering personalized, efficient, and intelligent automation and assistance. For instance, LLMs can generate bespoke workflows tailored to the specific objectives or requirements of a user by analyzing their purpose, past workflows, or even drawing inspiration from a vast repository of existing templates and workflows available on the internet. LLMs also facilitate continuous learning and adaptation within workflows. By analyzing performance data and user feedback, these models can suggest improvements, optimize existing processes. This adaptive capability ensures that workflows remain efficient, effective, and aligned with evolving objectives and conditions.

LLMs also permit to create new customized nodes with natural language instead of programming with less accessible languages like Python or Javascript.

Regarding the visualization of data, LLMs can also automate the extraction and analysis of the data offered by the workflows.

### The personal house cloud

The proliferation of hardware innovations has resulted in the advent of multi-device environments—spanning computers, mobile phones, tablets, and now virtual reality (VR) headsets—which underscore the necessity for a more unified and efficient method to manage and synchronize workflows across these varied platforms. This need has given rise to the concept of a "house cloud," a centralized, personal cloud infrastructure designed to host workflows and orchestrate tasks among all connected devices.
The house cloud acts as the backbone of this ecosystem, providing a centralized repository where workflows are stored, managed, and orchestrated. It enables seamless access to data and applications, regardless of the device being used, ensuring that users can pick up their work exactly where they left off, whether they switch from a computer to a tablet or from a mobile phone to a VR headset.
Orchestration across devices is a critical feature of the house cloud, allowing for the intelligent distribution and execution of tasks based on the unique capabilities and contextual advantages of each device. For example, detailed design work might be best suited to a tablet with a stylus, complex data analysis might leverage the computational power of a desktop computer, and immersive training or visualization tasks could be reserved for VR headsets.
The personal nature of the house cloud ensures that data and workflows remain secure and private, addressing growing concerns around data privacy and security in the cloud era. It offers users full control over their data and how it's shared across devices, creating a secure environment for both personal and professional work.

### The future
